# My CryptoHack Repo

This is a repo for all of my work relating to the CryptoHack platform. This includes things such as.

* Programs created to complete Courses
* Programs created to complete Challenges

This may eventually morph into a hand rolled implementation of common entry-level crypto functions. In no way should it
be considered cryptographically sound or safe as this is more so for learning / entertainment purposes.
